Led Zeppelin have celebrated their 50th anniversary as a band with the release of a new 50th Anniversary Interviews album. The band formed in 1968 before disbanding in 1980. They later reunited in 1985, 1988, 1995 and, most recently, in 2007.

The new album is comprised of 34 new interview clips from the bands surviving members, Jimmy Page, Robert Plant and John Paul Jones.

The clips see the band reflecting on their career, as well as specific songs and albums. They speak of their philosophy when it comes to recording new material, working with Ian Stewart, the musicality of Stairway to Heaven and more.

The band also digitally released their recent Record Store Day single, which featured unreleased versions of both Rock And Roll and Friends.

Earlier this year, following rumours of a 2019 Glastonbury headlining set, Robert Plant said the only way the band will reunite is in a chip shop.

Fans had also speculated that the band could get back together for some special shows to mark the 50th anniversary milestone, but guitarist Jimmy Page refuted that idea. The bands frontman backed him up while speaking to the Press Association recently, saying they could only [reunite] in a chip shop in Camden Town.

I think thats about as close as we will get to it, he said. We are very pleased and glad with our very, very short career. If you think about it, its only 12 years. We get on okay, but you know

Plant was also asked whether Led Zeppelin could be coerced into headlining Glastonbury next year. He replied: Nobody needs coercing. You either want to do something or you dont  or you can or you cant.
