Muse have shared a retro new video for their new single Pressure  described by the band as more of a straight Muse rock track.

Taken from their upcoming album Simulation Theory, Pressure follows on from recent singles The Dark Side, Thought Contagion, Something Human and Dig Down. While the tasters for the new record so far have leaned towards a more pop-friendly and electro-rock approach, frontman Matt Bellamy has said that this one is more traditional of the band.

Its more like a straight Muse rock track, Bellamy told Radio X. Its like a different riff every 10 seconds, basically.

The video opens with a VR headset being placed over an unseen persons head, before the scene shifts to a high school prom  seemingly recreating the prom scene in Back To The Future, with Muse assuming the role of the band and the frontman appearing to be dressed as Marty McFly. Terry Crews introduces the band as Rocket Baby Dolls  Muses first band name when they originally formed.

The clip also features Chance Michael and Julia Robinson, and was directed by Lance Drake.

Produced by Rich Costey, Mike Elizondo, Shellback and Timbaland, Simulation Theory is due for release on November 9, 2018.
