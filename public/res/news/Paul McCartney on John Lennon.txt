Paul McCartney has revealed that John Lennon only complimented him on his songwriting ability once  on a fan favourite track from Revolver.

The Beatles icon was speaking as part of an extensive 60 minutes profile interview for CBS, when he joked about the rare moment he shared with Lennon back in 1966.

It was Here, There and Everywhere, said McCartney. John says just as it finishes, Thats a really good song, lad. I love that song. And Im like, Yes! He likes it!

McCartney then said that he would often compliment Lennon, but that youd normally have to be a little drunk.

In other Beatles news, it was recently announced that the bands seminal White Album is due for re-release to celebrate the records 50th anniversary.

First released on November 22, 1968, the 50th anniversary of The White Album will be celebrated with a reissue housed in a series of lavishly presented packages, with its 30 tracks having been newly mixed by producer Giles Martin and mix engineer Sam Okell in stereo and 5.1 surround audio.

Meanwhile, today also saw McCartney announce the release of his first ever childrens book Hey Grandude  due for release in September 2019.
Ive written a new childrens picture book, said McCartney. Its called Hey Grandude! Why? Well Ive got eight grandchildren and theyre all beautiful and one day one of them said to me Hey Grandude!. I said What? and I thought, I kind of like that, so from then on I was kind of known as Grandude.

So I thought, you know what, its actually a nice idea for a book, so I started to write some stories, and then I talked to the book publishers and they liked what I was doing.
